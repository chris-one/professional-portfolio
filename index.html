           <h2>About Me</h2> 
           <div>Chris Hernandez is my name. For the last 17 years I've been enployeed at Union Pacific Railroad.
            I started at the age 22 and been there ever since. Within the first 2 years of my career, I pushed 
            myself to get into a foreman position. I wasn't scare or intimitaded of the responsibilities that came 
            with the position. I have been in charge of groups of 6 to 30 man gangs. I was in charge of
            of giving them a morning briefing of the task at hand, proper protection (safety), and making
            sure the job gets done properly and efficeintly. That they all go home safely to their family.
            Our jobs consist of fixing minor defects, to productions gangs (installing ties, or rails), to long 
            24 -72 hours shifts of fixing derailments.</div>

                <h2>Change of plans</h2>
                <div>For being there for so long. I decide to take Coding courses. It has been a challenge
                    for me, since I never done anything previous work experience in the tech world. But 
                    determined to finish. Through this course I have learned many deifferent tools.
                    I have learned HTML and CSS. I learned how to make repositories. Pull and push files.
                     Now our next study will be Javascript. I can honestly say I don't know where this is gonna
                    take me but I'm gonna continue this new journey with an open mind.</div>
